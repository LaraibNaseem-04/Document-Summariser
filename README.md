##  What It Does

Document Summary Assistant is a sleek web app that lets you summarize PDFs, images, or plain-text documents using AI. Just drag and drop or upload a file, choose the summary length, and get a concise summary with key points â€” powered entirely by React, Tailwind, and Gemini AI.

##  Features

- **Multi-format input**: Supports PDFs, images (OCR), and text files.
- **Drag & Drop + File Picker**: Intuitive file upload experience.
- **Summary Length Options**: Choose between *short*, *medium*, or *long* summaries.
- **Key Points Extraction**: Every summary is delivered alongside bullet-pointed highlights.
- **Instant Feedback**: Loading spinner and error handling ensure a smooth UX.
- **Client-side Processing**: PDF parsing and OCR happen in the browser; only the summary API call goes to Gemini.
